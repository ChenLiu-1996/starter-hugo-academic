<br> Hi, my name is Chen Liu.
<br> Or alternatively, 刘 晨 (family name followed by given name), pronounced as "Leo Chen".
<br>
<br> I am a second year CS PhD student at Yale.
<br> My area of research is primarily deep learning in healthcare.
<br> I worked on medical imaging a lot in the past, and I am recently focusing on understanding and interpreting the neural network manifolds.
