<br> Hi, my name is Chen Liu.

Or alternatively, 刘 晨 (family name followed by given name).

I am currently a 3rd-year PhD candidate at Yale University. My research explores both theory and application of machine learning. On the theory side, I focus on helping neural networks learn better representations in the latent space, and one of my most recent work studies the modeling of spatial-temporal dynamics. On the application side, I extend my research to medical imaging and other biomedical data.

Prior to pursuing my PhD, I graduated from Columbia University in 2019 with a master degree in Electrical Engineering. In my first industry job, I worked at a startup company named Matic (formerly called Matician) working on computer vision and SLAM. Then I worked as a senior research scientist at GE Healthcare, on deep learning in medical imaging applications.
