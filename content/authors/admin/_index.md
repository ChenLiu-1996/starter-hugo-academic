<br> Hi, my name is Chen Liu.
<br> Or alternatively, 刘 晨 (family name followed by given name).
<br>
<br> I am a second year CS PhD student at Yale.
<br> My area of research is machine learning, and more specifically, manifold learning.
<br><br> My research explores both theory and application of machine learning. On the research side, I focus on helping neural networks learn better representations in the latent space. On the application side, I extend my research to medical imaging and other biomedical data.
