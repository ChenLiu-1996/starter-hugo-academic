abstract: Brain extraction plays an integral role in image processing pipelines in both human and small animal preclinical MRI studies. Due to lack of state-of-the-art tools for automated brain extraction in rodent research, this step is often performed semi-supervised with manual correction, making it prone to inconsistent results. Here, we perform a multi-model brain extraction study and present a semi-automated preprocessing work ow and deep neural network with a 3D Residual Attention U-Net architecture as the optimal network for automated skull-stripping in neuroimaging analysis pipelines, achieving a DICE score of 0.987 and accuracy of 99.7%.
