abstract: The current pilot study was designed to examine the association between hippocampal γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA+) concentration and episodic memory in older individuals, as well as the impact of two major risk factors for Alzheimer's disease — female sex and Apolipoprotein ε4 (ApoE ε4) genotype — on this relationship.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This is a paper describing another scientific research that is largely helped by JET.
