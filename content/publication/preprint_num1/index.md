abstract: While MRI contrast agents such as those based on Gadolinium are needed to enhance the detection of structural and functional brain lesions, there are rising concerns over their safety. Here, we hypothesize that a deep learning model, trained using quantitative steady-state contrast-enhanced MRI datasets in mice and humans, could generate contrast-equivalent information from a single non-contrast MRI scan. The model was first trained, optimized, and validated in mice. It was then transferred and adapted to human data, and we find that it can substitute Gadolinium-based contrast agents for detecting functional lesions caused by aging, Schizophrenia, or Alzheimer's disease, and, 8 for enhancing structural lesions caused by brain or breast tumors. Since derived from a 9 commonly-acquired MRI, this framework has the potential for broad clinical utility and 10 can be applied retrospectively to research scans across a host of diseases.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We develop and optimize a deep learning algorithm to produce Gd contrast in mouse and human brain MRI directly from a single non-contrast structural MRI. We show sensible prediction results by quantitatively comparing not only the contrast images but also the downstream scientific findings with the ground truths on two species, eight studies, and various levels of brain disorders.
